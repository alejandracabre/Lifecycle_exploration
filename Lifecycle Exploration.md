# Lifecycle Exploration

## Context

Provide insights and analysis of users life cycle and the meeting impact on the conversion rate.

#### Caveat
* A date in the future was observed on a single case as a starting date. Again considering that it is just one, this could be discarded and considering noise, or perform a sanity check of the full data set.

## Subscriptions

As a Saas model company, most of the subscriptions are free ones, but both are increasing with the time.

### Days to convert

Is interesting to notice that the median of the days to convert, between the account creation and the payment, is decreasing with the time

### Conversion rate after meeting

In most of the cases, the meeting with representative happens after the trial period ends.

In a 2017 most of the online meeting were happening before the account were created, this situation can be pointing to an issue in the data or to specific  campaign, but with the available data it looks like it was not as successful as expected.

The average on days for conversion rate 45 days (50% of users), few days after the trial ends. In 2016 the likelihood to convert related to the  meeting it was 53%, but on 2017 decreased to 29%, probably related to the effort on do online meetings before the trial started.

Based on the available data, the likelihood of convert after the meeting is 29.72% as 2017, but is not having a lot of variations.



## Next Steps
* Considering that most of the users are free, definitely worth to do a deep analysis of free users, including ROI and cost per acquisition, among others.
* It will be possible to enrich the analysis and provide user segmentation as well as other relevant metrics (LTV, Churn and cohorts analysis), with more variables such as:
* Cancellations
* App usage
* Plans
