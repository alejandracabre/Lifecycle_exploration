## Data Exploration

1. First of all  I did the data exploration confirming that it was a relation 1:1 between both tables (Meeting report & Customer status) with each row having a unique customer_id.
It looks like the Online meeting is one single event per user.
After that I did a small data visualization exercise in Tableau in order to have a better understanding of the regular behavior as well as the outliers.
 
2.For the exercise it was created an instance in Google big Query in order to explore and crunch the data. and it was created a final dashboard in Google Data studio.
With this approach the dashboard will be updated automatically at the desired frequency.
